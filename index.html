               <h3>Google</h3>
               <p>after his big two hakks the haxor found that even though he owned 90% of the interwebz by this point by hakking everyone in the world, that google was still being used to search if the haxor was real. he then did his secret preparation and haxed google by making them search themselves over and over until they gave up to him. now people would not need to search for haxor as he was now the searcher itself</p>

               <h3>SpaceX</h3>
               <p>95% the interwebz was at this point under the 1337 haxor luxus control, but he had an obstacle ahead of him that he saw as his next target. spacex would allow him to control not only the interwebz on earth, but every in every universe in the world. following his normal preparations, he let loose a haxor nyancat that spread a virus to all of the spacex and servers in space and now he was almost done and lord of interwebz</p>

               <p>99.99999% of the interwebz has been hakked by the 1337 haxor, but one obstacle was in his way that he knew would be the hardest of all. those coders at launchcode that seemed to thwart him off at every time he tried to hax them. this time he used an ultra powerful secret preparation technique and then took 15 weeks of battling with the launchcode coders until finally he broke their main server and could say he owned the interwebz!!! he will never forget this mighty last battle</p>
